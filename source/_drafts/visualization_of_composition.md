4) Composition
It is used to show distribution of a variable across categories of another variable. Well known method to represent this is Pie chart. Though, I am not a big fan of pie chart as it is difficult to show distribution across multiple categories and angular comparison is difficult to understand. Hence, I prefer to work with Bar Chart.

Composition

Stacked Bar(image at right) chart is a type of Bar chart. It can compare distribution across different categories of two variables.
