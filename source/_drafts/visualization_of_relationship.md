3) Relationship
It is widely used to understand the correlation between two or more continuous variables. Most common method to visualize this information is Scatter Plot. It clearly shows the relationship between two variables. It usually draws a line of fit that best represent the relationship between data points. The line necessarily need not connect with data points.

We can also add third variable in scatter plot by using size of the points (known as Bubble Chart) or colors(as shown below).

BubbleChart

One of the problem with scatter plot is that it may get crowded if we have thousands or millions of data points. In this case,we can perform alpha blending, which makes each point slightly transparent. So regions appear darker that have more point plotted on them.
